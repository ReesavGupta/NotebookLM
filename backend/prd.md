# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Multimodal Notebook LLM Research Assistant

## 1. Overview

### Objective
Develop a production-ready, multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that ingests, processes, and reasons over complex documents containing text, images, tables, charts, and code snippetsâ€”delivering advanced research and knowledge management capabilities beyond NotebookLM, using open-source models and frameworks.

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria

### Goals
- Ingest and process 10+ file formats (text, image, code, tabular, and presentation)
- Enable advanced multimodal understanding and reasoning
- Support complex, cross-modal queries with accurate, context-rich answers
- Provide executive summaries, concept mapping, and relationship visualizations
- Ensure secure, collaborative, and scalable production deployment

### Success Criteria
- Accurate multimodal retrieval and summarization across diverse document types
- Real-time, collaborative research workflows
- Intuitive UI for document management, querying, and visualization
- Seamless integration with external tools and export formats
- High user satisfaction and adoption among technical/research users

## 3. User Stories

- **As a researcher**, I want to upload and organize diverse documents so I can centralize my research
- **As a user**, I want to ask complex questions (involving text, tables, and images) and get synthesized, evidence-backed answers
- **As a collaborator**, I want to share documents, queries, and insights in real time
- **As an analyst**, I want to visualize relationships between concepts/entities across documents
- **As an admin**, I want secure authentication and granular access control

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Document Ingestion & Processing
- Support for PDF, DOCX, HTML, CSV, XLSX, PPTX, Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), PNG, JPEG, SVG, and Markdown
- Parse and extract text, images, tables, charts, and code snippets
- Maintain document hierarchy (sections, headings, figure/table references)
- Chunk documents by logical sections for context preservation

### 4.2 Multimodal Understanding & Embedding
- Use open-source multimodal models (e.g., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, CLIP) for unified image and text embeddings
- Extract and store embeddings for text, images, tables, and code
- OCR for images/tables where needed, with fallback to text embedding

### 4.3 Storage & Metadata Management
- Store document metadata (title, author, date, modality, etc.) in a relational database
- Attach relevant metadata to each document chunk in the vector store for fine-grained retrieval and filtering
- Support scalable vector storage (Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch with pgvector)

### 4.4 Query Engine & Hybrid Search
- Accept natural language and cross-modal queries
- Decompose complex queries into sub-queries and synthesize results
- Implement hybrid search: combine dense vector (semantic) and sparse (keyword/BM25) retrieval
- Support metadata filtering and faceting

### 4.5 Summarization & Synthesis
- Generate executive summaries across single or multiple documents
- Use both extractive and abstractive summarization models
- Synthesize insights from text, images, tables, and charts

### 4.6 Relationship & Concept Mapping
- Extract and map entities, concepts, and relationships within and across documents
- Store relationships in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j)
- Provide interactive visualizations (Gephi, DBDiagram, or Creately)

### 4.7 User Management & Collaboration
- Secure user authentication (OAuth2, JWT, or Auth0)
- Document and query history tracking
- Real-time collaboration (WebSockets or Firebase)
- Role-based access control

### 4.8 Export & Integration
- Export insights as PDF, DOCX, Markdown, or CSV
- Provide RESTful APIs and webhooks for external integrations

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Handle large document volumes and concurrent users
- **Performance**: Low-latency query responses and real-time updates
- **Security**: Data encryption, secure authentication, and access controls
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture for easy addition of new modalities or models
- **Reliability**: Fault-tolerant, with robust error handling and monitoring

## 6. Architecture Overview

| Layer | Technology Choices (Open Source) |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| Backend API | FastAPI (Python) or NodeJS (TypeScript) |
| Frontend | React or Streamlit |
| Document Processing | Unstructured, Docling, custom parsers |
| Multimodal AI | LLaVA, Pixtral, Florence-2, Llama3.2-vision, Qwen2-VL |
| Vector Database | Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, Postgres+pgvector |
| Orchestration | LlamaIndex, LangChain |
| Graph Database | Neo4j |
| Visualization | Gephi, DBDiagram, Creately |

## 7. Sample User Flow

1. **Upload**: User uploads research papers, manuals, financial reports, code docs, or slides
2. **Processing**: System parses, chunks, and embeds all content, preserving structure and metadata
3. **Query**: User asks a multimodal question (e.g., "Summarize the financial trends in these reports and show related charts")
4. **Retrieval**: Hybrid search retrieves relevant text, images, and tables
5. **Synthesis**: System generates an executive summary with supporting visuals
6. **Relationship Mapping**: User explores concept/entity relationships via interactive graphs
7. **Export/Share**: Insights are exported or shared with collaborators
